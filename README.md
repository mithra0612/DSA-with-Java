<h1>DSA Practice and LeetCode Solutions Repository</h1>

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! This repository contains all the codes I've written while solving LeetCode problems and other DSA challenges using Java. Here, I track my DSA journey as I continue to learn, practice, and refine my DSA skills.

<h3>üìÇ Repository Structure</h3>
LeetCode/: Contains all the solutions for LeetCode problems, organized by problem number and topic.
Daily-Journey/: A day-wise breakdown of my DSA practice and learning, including coding challenges, learning resources, and notes.
Other-DSA-Problems/: Contains solutions for problems from other platforms or additional DSA challenges.

<h3>üöÄ Daily Learning Journey</h3>
Each day, I aim to:
Solve at least 1-2 new problems from LeetCode.
Review and improve solutions for previously solved problems.
Study new algorithms or data structures to improve my understanding.

In the Daily-Journey/ folder, you‚Äôll find markdown files tracking my progress, such as:
Day 1: Introduction to Arrays
Day 2: LeetCode Problem 39 - Combination Sum

Each day's file contains:
Problems solved.
Notes on new algorithms or data structures learned.
Challenges faced and how I overcame them.
Personal reflections on the day's learning experience.

<h3>üõ† Technologies Used</h3>
Java: The primary programming language for solving DSA problems.
Markdown: For documenting my journey and notes.

<h3>üå± Goals</h3>
Short-Term:
Solve 150+ LeetCode problems across a variety of topics.
Get a strong understanding of time and space complexity analysis.
Long-Term:
Build a solid foundation in DSA to prepare for technical interviews.
Develop efficient problem-solving skills for competitive programming and coding interviews.
