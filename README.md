<h1>DSA Practice and LeetCode Solutions Repository</h1>

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! This repository contains all the codes I've written while solving LeetCode problems and other DSA challenges using Java. Here, I track my DSA journey as I continue to learn, practice, and refine my DSA skills.

<h3>🚀 Daily Learning Journey</h3>
Each day, I aim to:
<ul>Solve at least 1-2 new problems from LeetCode.</ul>
<ul>Review and improve solutions for previously solved problems.</ul>
<ul>Study new algorithms or data structures to improve my understanding.</ul>

Each day's file contains:
Problems solved.
<ul>Notes on new algorithms or data structures learned.</ul>
<ul>Challenges faced and how I overcame them.</ul>
<ul>Personal reflections on the day's learning experience.</ul>

<h3>🛠 Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>Java: The primary programming language for solving DSA problems.</ul>
<ul>Java: Markdown: For documenting my journey and notes.</ul>

<h3>🌱 Goals</h3>
Short-Term:
Solve 200+ LeetCode problems across a variety of topics.
Get a strong understanding of time and space complexity analysis.
Long-Term:
Build a solid foundation in DSA to prepare for technical interviews.
Develop efficient problem-solving skills for competitive programming and coding interviews.
